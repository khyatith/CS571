CS571
=====
Hi,

This is the project that I did in my CS571 Web Technologies class. 
I created a website for a company that sells cakes for different occassions. 
This is the customer side of the website. Customers can browse through different cakes and can create/delete/edit their shopping carts. They can checkout only when they are logged in.

Customers can signup and login and order cakes. They also have the option of viewing/editing their profile information. Also they can view their order history.

I have used PHP,MYSQL,HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT,JQUERY and AJAX to create this website. I have created the responsive layout to be viewed on different mobile devices as well using JQUERY MOBILE. 

I used an MVC framework , CodeIgniter to create this website.
